# DEEP THOUGHTS

# Implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe
# and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two.
# Otherwise output No.


# ===============================================================================


user_answer = input("The Answer to the Great Question of Life is? ").strip().lower()

match user_answer:
    case "42" | "forty-two" | "forty two":
        print("Yes")
    case _:
        print("No")
